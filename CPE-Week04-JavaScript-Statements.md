In Week 4, we are introducing two fundamental topics in computer engineering, as well as more features of JavaScript: 
- Binary – the number (aka numeral) system used in computing 
- Electricity – the natural phenomenon on which computing has been built 
- Statements - statements in programming languages are like the sentences in human speech
- Enumerated types – data types that are collection of names (like the names of variables)
