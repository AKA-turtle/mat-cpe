In Week 4, we are introducing two fundamental topics in computer engineering, as well as more features of JavaScript: 
- [Binary number system](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e9QTeYUYFm5DyQIz6qbM0OUYKsh8nf36WEvbQq3O8uk/edit#) – the number (aka numeral) system used in computing 
- [Electricity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rHwjfT52t8e8BeC3xgw7rdLXgL3fGsUDZzf24rT2oK4/edit#) – the natural phenomenon on which computing has been built 
- [Statements](CPE-Week04-JavaScript-Statements.md) - statements in programming languages are like the sentences in human speech
- [Enumerated types](CPE-Week04-JavaScript-Enum-Types.md) – JavaScript data types that are just collections of names (like the names of variables)
