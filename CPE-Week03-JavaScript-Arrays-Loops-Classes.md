In Week 3, we are introducing the following topics:
- Arrays - one of the most useful _data structures_ in programming
- Loops - the programming language facility for repeated execution
- Classes - the programming language facility for user-defined data types and the heart of object-oriented programming

TODO:
Transfer from [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1foQX3e02-tlm4wPc3Cn0XllIsEeciJJlq93_DFRITDg/) and add code examples.
